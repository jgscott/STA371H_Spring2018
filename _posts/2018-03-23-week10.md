title: Week 10 (March 26-28, 2018)
---

At the beginning of class on Monday, we will finish up our in-class case study on "green" buildings.  See the [green_match.R script.]({{ site.baseurl }}/rscripts/green_match.R)

For the next several weeks, we will switch gears from regression modeling and start to consider a different set of ideas: those surrounding probability and decision-making.  

On Monday, we will start Chapter 10 of the course packet, aiming to cover:  
- expected value for repeated, independent events  
- the NP rule  
- the NNT in medicine  


On Wednesday, we will finish up Chapter 10, covering the basic rules of probability.  With whatever time remains on Wednesday, we will start into Chapter 11.  We will aim to cover:  
-  Joint, conditional, and marginal probabilities  
-  Rule of total probability   
-  Aggregation paradoxes in probability   


### Readings

By Monday of next week (week 11), please finish reading Chapters 10-11 of the course packet.
