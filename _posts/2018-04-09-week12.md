title: Week 12 (April 9-11, 2018)
---

On Monday, we will finish Chapter 12 of the course packet, on independence and compounding.  We will focus on the topic of lurking variables and the fallacy of mistaken compounding.  Our in-class case study will involve a close look at the topic of contraceptive effectiveness:
- [Contraceptive effectiveness chart](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/mmwr/mec/intro.html#Figure).  Scroll all the way to the bottom for the chart.  
- [How likely is it that birth control will let you down?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/14/sunday-review/unplanned-pregnancies.html)  

If there is any time available, we will introduce Chapter 13, on Bayes' rule.  

On Wednesday, we finish Chapter 13.  Key ideas:  
- prior and posterior probabilities  
- likelihood  
- confusion matrix  
- base-rate neglect   


### Software

You should base your homework this work off the [green_match.R]({{ site.baseurl }}/rscripts/green_match.R) script from a couple of weeks ago, which demonstrates the basic skills of matching (and matching + regression) for estimating a causal effect.  


### Readings

By Monday of next week (week 13), please read:
- All of Chapter 13, on Bayes' rule.  
- Chapter 14 through 270 (stopping at the top of page 271).  You can safely skip the subsection entitled "Advanced topic: a derivation of the binomial distribution."  


### Exercises  

[Exercises 7 this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises07-STA371H.pdf) are on cause-and-effect reasoning and basic probability.   They are due in class next on Monday, April 16.
