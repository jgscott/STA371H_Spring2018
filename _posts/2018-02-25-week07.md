title: Week 8 (February 26-28, 2018)
---


On Monday, we will go over how to conduct a permutation test in a linear regression model.  You can follow along with the "saratoga_test.R" script, from the R Scripts tab above.  

On Wednesday, we will cover Chapter 8 of the course packet in class.  The main topics are:  
- measuring generalization error using RMSPE.  
- building and checking a predictive model.  
- stepwise selection.  

You can follow along with the "saratoga_stepwise.R" script, from the R Scripts tab above.  

### Software

Outside of class, complete the following R walkthrough.

Before Monday of next week (week 7), so that you can complete your homework:  
- [Google flu trends](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/flu/flu.md): Building and checking a predictive model for flu using stepwise selection on Google search data.   


### Readings

By Monday of next week, please read Chapter 8 of the course packet.  You will need these ideas in order to complete your homework this week.  


### Videos  

Owing to the many, many other things going on in your school lives these two weeks, there are no additional videos to watch before the midterm.  We will cover everything in class.  


### Exercises  

[Exercises 6 this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises06-STA371H.pdf) are on multiple regression modeling and stepwise selection.   They are due in class on March 5.
