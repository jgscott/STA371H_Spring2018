### R Walkthroughs

[These modules](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR) will teach you basic R skills by guiding you through some simple data analyses. 

### Course packet

[Part I of the course packet is here.]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/DataScience_Part1.pdf) 

We won't get to Part II until after Spring Break.  I'm still tinkering a bit with that part based on feedback from last year's course, so it's not ready yet.  But I'll post it well before you need it.  

### Old exams

[Midterm from 2017]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/midterm_STA371H_spring2017.pdf) and [grading guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/midterm_STA371H_spring2017-guide.pdf)


### Other readings

* [Data Analysis for Politics and Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/DAPP.pdf) by Edward Tufte.  Out of print, but available for free in electronic form. I will often assign supplemental readings out of this book.  
* [Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/) by Daniel Kaplan.  Great book, great exercises.  The first five chapters are available for free (half-way down the page under the "Read Online" heading).  You will find the first one especially helpful in learning some basic R commands.  You are not required to buy this book, but you may find it a useful resource. Readings will be assigned out of the first five (free) chapters.
* [Using R for Introductory Statistics](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf).  A useful guide on doing basic statistics in R.
* [OpenIntro: Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php).  A free online statistics textbook that I will refer to many times throughout the semester for supplemental readings.


### Good places to get help with R

* [R Seek](http://rseek.org).  A front-end for Google that helps get more Relevant results.  
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). Just search for a relevant question and somebody has probably answered it before.
