### Midterm week  

The midterm will be in class this Wednesday.  Please bring pens and a [blue book](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZXYfFBRHL.jpg).  

The review session will take place on Tuesday evening, March 6, from 5:30 - 7:00 PM in UTC 3.104. 

I have compiled a [two-page reminder sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/review_midterm.pdf) of major concepts, for your reference.
